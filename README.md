# Ecommerce_membership_levels
An analysis and recommendation system for enhancing the membership program of an eCommerce platform. 
This project is a mock/practice exercise undertaken as part of a 6-week bootcamp focusing on data science and machine learning hosted by [Code3Camp](https://www.code3camp.dev/). It serves as a portfolio-building initiative aimed at showcasing practical skills and experience in the field and utilizes data obtained from Kaggle to explore insights into customer spending behavior and propose strategies for optimizing the membership program. Leveraging data analysis and statistical methods, including one-way ANOVA and predictive modeling, this project aims to assess the effectiveness of existing membership tiers (gold, silver, bronze) and proposes the introduction of a new platinum membership level. Explore segmentation analysis, predictive modeling, and recommendations to drive revenue growth and customer satisfaction in eCommerce membership programs.
